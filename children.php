              At <strong>New Harvest Fellowship Church</strong>, our <strong>Children’s Ministry</strong> is a vibrant, Christ-centered outreach that meets every Saturday from 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM. This ministry is more than just a gathering; it's a safe haven where children experience God’s love, receive spiritual nourishment, and are cared for holistically.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Each Saturday, children engage in:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bible teaching and memory versesto help them grow in their knowledge of God's Word.</li>
              <li>Fun games and activities build community and joy.</li>
              <li>Guidance and counseling sessions to support their emotional and spiritual well-being.</li>
              <li>A childcare program where we look after the younger children while their guardians are engaged elsewhere.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As part of our commitment to care for the whole child, we provide meals during our Saturday programs, recognizing that many children come from homes where food is scarce. We also identify children with urgent physical needs, including those who face chronic hunger. For these, we supply <strong>monthly food packages</strong> to help sustain them and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our ministry prioritizes orphans and the most vulnerable children in our community. We provide school supplies, uniforms, shoes, and books especially for those transitioning to secondary school without the necessary requirements. This support ensures that children are not left behind simply because of poverty or hardship.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>Children’s Ministry</strong> is a vital part of our mission to restore dignity, faith, and hope to the youngest and most vulnerable members of our community, raising a new generation that is strong in the Lord and equipped for the future.
