            <p>
              At New Harvest Fellowship Church, we believe the Church is called to go beyond its walls and reach people where they are. That’s why our Outreach Program is at the heart of our mission to bring the hope of the Gospel and practical help to the poor, broken, and forgotten in our community and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Located in Chibe, Shinyanga, Tanzania, our outreach efforts are a response to deep-rooted issues such as poverty, hunger, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, alcohol abuse, and spiritual darkness. In this hard place, we carry the light of Christ through acts of compassion, evangelism, and discipleship.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What We Do Through Outreach:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Village Gospel Crusades: We take the good news of Jesus to unreached and underserved villages, partnering with indigenous churches to host mini crusades, pray for the sick, and strengthen struggling congregations.</li>
                <li>School Evangelism: We reach students in primary and secondary schools through Bible clubs, mentorship, and provision of school supplies and meals.</li>
                <li>Relief Aid: We respond to hunger and need with food distributions, especially during the dry season when families struggle to find daily meals.</li>
                <li>Children & Orphans Support: We support orphans and vulnerable children with clothing, school uniforms, and educational materials to ensure they stay in school and know they are loved.</li>
                <li>Discipleship & Church Planting: We train and support rural church planters who are reaching people in deeply superstitious and neglected regions.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
