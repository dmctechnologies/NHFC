        <h2 class="text-justify">Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">We are Pastor Jacob and Lady Happy, and we are so excited to welcome you to our Harvest Fellowship Church website. We believe that every person who walks through our doors is a beloved child of God, and we’re thrilled to have you join us in our journey of faith.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Here at NHFC, located in the heart of Chibe, Shinyanga, Tanzania, we are more than just a church—we are a family. We are a vibrant, Pentecostal Apostolic movement, focused on making disciples, preaching the unchanging word of God, and serving with a heart for mission. We are passionate about worshiping, praising, and loving God, while also growing together to serve the people around us.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">In this family, we believe that no matter where you are in your faith journey, you matter. Whether you’re new to faith or have been walking with Jesus for years, we are here to help one another grow in the love of Christ. We are committed to being disciples of Jesus who make more disciples, and we encourage everyone to be part of this process.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">At NHFC, we don’t just see your perfection; we see God's grace in our weakness, and we embrace the mercy of God in our mistakes. We are a people saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. None of us has a perfect background, but together, we are learning to glorify God with our lives.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Our church is full of energy and passion—a place where we sing, dance, read the scriptures, preach the word, pray, and meditate together to feed our souls and bring glory to God. We are a new generation of believers, and our hearts are open to all who wish to join in this mission.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Once again, welcome to the Harvest Fellowship family! We are here to pray with you, grow with you, and serve with you. We believe in a God who is faithful and will meet you right where you are.</p>
